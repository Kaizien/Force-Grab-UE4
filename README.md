# Force-Grab-UE4

This project started out as a basic example of the "gravity gun" from Half-life 2. The fps base project was used to set up the project.
*Left click creates a line trace to the object that is being "force grabbed", and the object will be pulled to you and held by the player.
*Clicking left click while holding an object "shoots" the object in the direction that you are aiming.

This project also includes a functioning HUD. The HUD contains information for the player such as experience, health, and mana (consumed when grabbing an object). 
*variables for max hp, max mana, current hp, current mana
*mana regeneration controlled by a timer. both the amount of mana regeneration per tick and tick duration can be modified within the player controller blueprint.
